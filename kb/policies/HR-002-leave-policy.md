# Summary
Details the process for requesting and approving planned/unplanned leave, including approvers and HR points of contact.

# Details
## Leave Types
- **Paid Time Off (PTO)**: accrues monthly; submit requests 5 business days in advance.
- **Sick Leave**: notify manager ASAP; HR requires doctor's note beyond 3 consecutive days.
- **Parental Leave**: coordinate with HR at least 30 days ahead; follow local regulations.

## Request Flow
1. Employee submits request via Workday with dates + coverage plan.
2. Direct manager approves/denies within 2 business days.
3. For PTO > 10 consecutive days, VP approval required.
4. HRBP updates payroll and records in the leave ledger.
