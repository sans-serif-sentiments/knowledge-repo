## Scope
Applies to all employees and contractors using AI models or tools (local or SaaS) for company work.

## Principles
- Be lawful and respectful of privacy and IP.
- Avoid harmful, biased, or misleading outputs; include human oversight for sensitive actions.
- Use only approved tools and models; log material AI interactions for audit when required.

## Prohibited Uses
- Feeding regulated or sensitive PII/PCI/PHI unless explicitly approved and protected.
- Generating deceptive, discriminatory, or unreviewed customer-facing content.
- Bypassing access controls or exporting training data from approved environments.

## Required Controls
- Use approved models/tools (see AI-002 and tool-specific policies).
- Apply data minimization and redaction; follow classification (SEC-003) before prompt/attachment.
- Keep humans-in-the-loop for external comms, legal, security, and HR decisions.
- Log prompts/outputs when handling sensitive workflows; follow retention per CP-004.

## Review & Exceptions
- Exceptions require written approval from AI Governance + Compliance.
- Re-review this policy at least annually or after major model/tool changes.
