# Summary
Defines the approved tone, voice, and citation rules for all outbound communications, including enablement decks and customer emails.

# Details
## Tone Principles
- Clear and confident, never hype-driven.
- Cite data sources for every metric; link to KB IDs when possible.
- Flag uncertainty explicitly ("We do not yet have data on ...").

## Messaging Rules
1. Highlight user value before technical detail.
2. Use inclusive language; avoid idioms that may not translate globally.
3. Use the `Reasonable Interpretation` label when sharing extrapolated insights.

# Examples
- Release note snippet referencing metric MT-001 with proper citation.

# References
- Brand book (internal)
- Enablement checklist EN-001
