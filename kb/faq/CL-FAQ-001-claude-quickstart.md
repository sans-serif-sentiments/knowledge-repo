## Common Questions
- **Can I paste customer data?** Only if approved and classified; otherwise redact/minimize.
- **Are prompts logged?** Sensitive workflows require logging per CP-004; check your project setup.
- **How do I get access?** Request via CL-PR-001 with justification.
- **What models can I use?** Approved list is in AI-002 and CL-PL-001; stick to enterprise tenant defaults.
- **If something looks wrong?** Stop, file AI-PR-002, and notify AI Platform + Security.
