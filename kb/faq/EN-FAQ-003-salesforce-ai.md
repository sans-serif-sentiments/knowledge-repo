# Summary
Answers the most common questions sellers ask when using the AI assistant embedded in Salesforce.

# Details
1. **Who can use it?** All quota-carrying reps and CS managers with Salesforce licenses.
2. **What data does it read?** Only the account/opportunity records you can already access; it uses AI-KMS for policy lookups.
3. **How do I log AI suggestions?** Use the “AI Assist Summary” field; the assistant auto-populates citations.
4. **Can I ask pricing questions?** No, route pricing to finance via CO-003; the assistant will remind you.
5. **Where do I report bugs?** Submit a ticket in the RevOps queue and tag `langgraph`.
