## Common Questions
1) **Can I paste PII?** Only if approved and classified per SEC-003; otherwise redact/minimize and use local tools.
2) **Which tools are approved?** See AI-002; local (Ollama) and Claude (enterprise) for non-regulated tasks.
3) **How do I request a new model/tool?** File AI-PR-001 with test plan and rollback.
4) **What if the model misbehaves?** Trigger AI-PR-002; disable/rollback and notify AI Governance + SOC.
5) **Can I use AI for customer emails?** Yes with human review; follow CO-004/CO-005 tone and approval paths.
6) **How are prompts/outputs stored?** Logged per CP-004 retention; sensitive workflows require audit logging.
