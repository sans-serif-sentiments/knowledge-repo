# Summary
Reusable structure for informing strategic customers about risk, privacy, or availability topics without overwhelming them with internal jargon.

# Details
## Sections
1. **Executive Snapshot** – 2 bullets on what happened + current status (reference SEC-002 facts).
2. **Customer Impact** – map severity to customer-facing systems and SLAs.
3. **Actions We Took** – highlight containment + remediation owners.
4. **What We Need From You** – optional steps for customer admins.

## Writing Guardrails
- Cite policies (HR-002, FIN-001) if guidance references HR or Finance workflows.
- Avoid acronyms without definitions; list contacts for escalations.
- Include `Last Updated` timestamp and link to trust center.
