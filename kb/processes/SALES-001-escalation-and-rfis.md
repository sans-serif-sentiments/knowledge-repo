## When to escalate
- Deal at risk, blocked by pricing/terms, or needs exec visibility.
- Customer asks for security/privacy details (RFI/questionnaires).
- Unusual use of AI/ML or data residency concerns.

## Steps
1) Log escalation in CRM (tag the opportunity); include issue, deadline, and requested support.
2) For RFIs: submit to the RFI portal; attach questionnaire, deadline, and customer profile.
3) Engage Security RFIs for SOC2/ISO reports and data handling statements.
4) If pricing/terms exception is needed, loop Finance/Legal via Procurement (FIN-002).

## Response SLAs
- Escalation triage: 1 business day.
- Standard security RFI: 3–5 business days (depends on questionnaire depth).
