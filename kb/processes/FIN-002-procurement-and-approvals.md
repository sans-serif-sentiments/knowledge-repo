## When to engage Procurement
- New vendor, renewal, or any spend > $5,000.
- Any contract with data processing or AI/ML services requires Security/Privacy review.

## Steps
1) Submit request in the procurement portal with business justification, budget owner, and expected spend.
2) Attach SOW/quote; identify data types processed.
3) Procurement routes for approvals: budget owner, Security (if data), Legal (contracts), Finance (spend).
4) Complete vendor due diligence (see SEC-005); capture DPAs where needed.
5) PO issued; only then proceed with purchase.

## SLAs
- Intake triage: 1 business day.
- Standard review: 5–10 business days (dependent on Legal/Security inputs).

## Prohibited/hold scenarios
- Unapproved data transfers, missing security/privacy attestations, or unsigned contracts.
