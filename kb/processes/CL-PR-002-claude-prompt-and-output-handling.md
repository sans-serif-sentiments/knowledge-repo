## Steps
- Classify data before prompting (SEC-003); redact PII/credentials.
- Use approved templates for sensitive workflows; log prompts/outputs when required.
- Do not store outputs in uncontrolled locations; follow retention (CP-004).
- If output seems unsafe or policy-violating, stop and file AI-PR-002 incident.
